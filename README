Status and License
------------------

``jaraco.video`` is a port of the `VideoCapture module
<http://videocapture.sourceforge.net/>`_ in pure Python using ctypes
and comtypes.

``jaraco.video`` is maintained by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under
an `MIT-style permissive license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.

You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.video``, or from the
`mercurial repository
<http://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.video/get/tip.zip#egg=jaraco.video-dev>`_
with
``easy_install jaraco.video==dev``.

`jaraco.video` is designed to run on Python 2.5+, including Python 3,
and including 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Python.

Issues
------

Although the package currently installs on Python 3, there is currently
no supported version of PIL for Python 3, so only raw bitmap data will
be available (no JPEG support, etc).

Usage
-----

`jaraco.video` includes a console script "save-frame", which
locates the first video capture device and saves a single frame
to disk as "test.jpg". The command may also be invoked thus::

    python -m jaraco.video.capture

This example usage can be seen in the function
`jaraco.video.capture:save_frame`.

History
-------

1.2
~~~

* #1: Require jaraco.util for bitutil, which has progressed with better Python
  3 support.
* #2: Added a hard dependency on Pillow for imaging. The library is pretty
  useless without it. If there is a use-case out there for using the library
  without Pillow, please file a request ticket.

1.1
~~~

* Moved typelibs so they will be included with the build.
* Fixed ImportError on Python 3.
* Added readme.

1.0
~~~

* First non-dev release. Typelibs are included and comtypes libs are
  generated automatically.
