1.2.1
~~~~~

* Fixed several errors in the code due to untested refactorings for Python 3
  support. The code now runs properly under Python 3.
* #3: Added notes about deploying the latest version of comtypes with bug
  fixes from jaraco's mirror.

1.2
~~~

* #1: Require jaraco.util for bitutil, which has progressed with better Python
  3 support.
* #2: Added a hard dependency on Pillow for imaging. The library is pretty
  useless without it. If there is a use-case out there for using the library
  without Pillow, please file a request ticket.

1.1
~~~

* Moved typelibs so they will be included with the build.
* Fixed ImportError on Python 3.
* Added readme.

1.0
~~~

* First non-dev release. Typelibs are included and comtypes libs are
  generated automatically.
